Guidelines for Creating Accessible Printed Posters by checking font styles

- Is the font choice legible enough? (Font type)
  o Use non-serif (san-serif) fonts (University of Edenburgh, 2005).
  o Serif means a small decorative line added as embellishment to the
  basic form or main strokes of an alphabetical letter. Typefaces are
  often described as being serif or sans serif (without serifs). The most
  common serif typeface is Times Roman. A common sans serif
  typeface is Helvetica. Serif fonts can be more difficult to read,
  particularly the more decorative, hand written, and italicized fonts


Figure 2: Example serif and sans serif font.
Notice the sans serif Arial font does not have decorative tails at the end of
character strokes unlike the Harrington font.
